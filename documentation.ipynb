    "# ROMBOT AI Travel Planner - Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "ROMBOT is an AI-powered travel planner application that creates personalized travel itineraries for users based on their preferences, budget, and interests. The application uses the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model to generate detailed day-by-day travel plans tailored to each user's unique requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technologies Used\n",
    "- **Frontend & Backend**: Streamlit\n",
    "- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash\n",
    "- **External APIs**: Unsplash (for destination images)\n",
    "- **Environment Management**: dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components\n",
    "1. **User Input Collection**: Form-based interface for gathering travel preferences\n",
    "2. **Image Retrieval System**: Integration with Unsplash API for destination imagery\n",
    "3. **AI Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for Gemini model\n",
    "4. **Itinerary Generation**: Markdown-based output with custom styling\n",
    "5. **User Interface**: Enhanced with custom CSS for visual appeal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompt (Input Refinement)\n",
    "The system uses a structured prompt to gather comprehensive user information and generate personalized itineraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Generate a detailed {days}-day travel itinerary for {destination}. \n",
    "- Budget level: {budget} \n",
    "- Purpose: {purpose} \n",
    "- Interests: {interests}\n",
    "\n",
    "For each day include:\n",
    "- Morning, afternoon, and evening activities\n",
    "- Local food recommendations with estimated costs\n",
    "- Accommodation suggestions\n",
    "- Transportation details\n",
    "- Local tips and cultural insights\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Rationale:**\n",
    "This prompt is designed to capture all essential travel parameters while ensuring the model produces structured, comprehensive output. The inclusion of specific categories (morning/afternoon/evening activities, food, accommodation, transport) guarantees a complete travel plan rather than general suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Instructions (Output Enhancement)\n",
    "To improve user experience, the system includes detailed formatting instructions within the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "1. Format the itinerary in Markdown with clear headings for each day and section.\n",
    "2. Use emoji icons generously for better visual appeal.\n",
    "3. Mark famous landmarks and must-visit destinations as <span class=\"famous-spot\">Famous Landmark Name</span>\n",
    "4. Put essential travel tips in <div class=\"tip-card\">Tip content goes here</div>\n",
    "5. Highlight any must-see attractions or special experiences using <div class=\"highlight-spot\">Content here</div>\n",
    "6. Format food recommendations like: <span class=\"food-item\">Dish Name</span> (~$XX)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Rationale:**\n",
    "These detailed instructions ensure the output is not only informative but also visually engaging. Custom HTML classes leverage the application's CSS to create a polished, professional presentation that makes complex itineraries easy to read and navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Input Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Input Parameters:\n",
    "1. **Destination**: Text input for the travel location\n",
    "2. **Trip Duration**: Slider (1-21 days)\n",
    "3. **Budget Level**: Selection (Low, Moderate, Luxury)\n",
    "4. **Purpose of Travel**: Selection (Adventure, Relaxation, Work, Culture, Family, Solo)\n",
    "5. **Interests**: Multi-select (Nature, History, Cuisine, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Refinement Strategy:\n",
    "- The application uses descriptive labels and visual cues to guide users\n",
    "- Multi-select options for interests allow for nuanced preference expression\n",
    "- Budget levels are described with emoji indicators for clarity\n",
    "- Required fields are validated before processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI Response Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The application processes AI responses through the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input Collection**: Parameters are gathered from the UI\n",
    "2. **Prompt Construction**: Dynamic prompt creation based on user inputs\n",
    "3. **AI Model Invocation**: Request sent to Gemini 1.5 Flash\n",
    "4. **Response Formatting**: AI output is rendered with custom CSS classes\n",
    "5. **Display Integration**: Result is presented in a card-based UI component\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def generate_itinerary(destination, days, budget, purpose, interests):\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "    Generate a detailed {days}-day travel itinerary for {destination}. \n",
    "    - Budget level: {budget} \n",
    "    - Purpose: {purpose} \n",
    "    - Interests: {', '.join(interests)}\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    model = genai.GenerativeModel(\"gemini-1.5-flash\")\n",
    "    response = model.generate_content(prompt)\n",
    "    return response.text if response else \"No itinerary generated.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
